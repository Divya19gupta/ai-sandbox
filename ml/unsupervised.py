MEAN & CENTROID:

Mean: It is average divide by total
Centroid: On the graph the center point considering both axis (xmid,ymid). This is what KMeans try to find. 
It tried to find the middle in each group to get an idea how to divide the clusters in categories

So if you ask the machine who's my regular customer it'll use centroid and then use mean to compare if the value is more or less
for clustering the similar type of data togeather using centroid

Centroid = Mean point in many dimensions
Mean = Average value in one dimension
