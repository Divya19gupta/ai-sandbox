# Introduction to Matplotlib
# It is used to convert boring data into beautiful graphs and visualizations.

#RULES:
# 1. Ask the story/question. Don't start with chart directly.
# 2. Choose the right chart type or match the chart according to the data.
# 3. Keep it simple and label everything.
# 4. Use colors wisely and keep it simple and don't overdo it.
# Story -> Chart -> Clarity

#Seaborn uses matplotlib interanally for plotting graphs. It uses less code and also makes the graphs look better by default.
